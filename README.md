## Why these notes?
The slides provided by instructors are often too concise and, in some cases, completely useless.  
**How could slides made of only images or with just one sentence help me?**

For this reason, I decided to share these slides, which are like the course slides but **heavily annotated** so that reading them is finally understandable (I hope—if not, feel free to insult me).

The notes include:

1.  The instructors’ words during lectures.  
2.  My own rewrites of certain concepts to try to understand them better.  
3.  Research done on the Internet (e.g. answers from StackOverflow / StackExchange).  

Some notes are written in Italian and others in English. Non-Italian students can copy and paste the Italian notes into a translator.

## How do I view the annotations?

To see the notes, you need to install [PDF-XChange Editor](https://pdf-xchange.eu/DL/pdf-xchange-editor.htm) (free, and the software I used to add the annotations) or [Adobe Acrobat Reader](https://get.adobe.com/uk/reader/) (also free—do NOT confuse this with the paid version). I’m not sure if other software will display the notes correctly.

> [!WARNING]  
> Sometimes, for unknown reasons, these programs will close pop-up notes. Make sure they are visible.

> [!CAUTION]  
> Unfortunately, opening the PDFs in a browser (Chrome, Edge) does not display the notes properly (the text gets truncated if it’s too long), or it’s terribly inconvenient to read them (you have to hover over each highlighted area with your mouse to see if a note appears).

## A few minor details:
1.  A few notes are labeled "Check ChatGPT,” which means that after reading the slide and doing online research I still found it unclear. What I did was copy the slide’s text and ask ChatGPT (using the most capable model available) to explain it in detail. If you see "Check ChatGPT” on a note, I encourage you to do the same.  
2.  In some notes I refer to other slides with phrases like “Compare with slide 24 / 56.” This means go to slide 24 (out of 56) of the PDF. I mention this because in some cases the slide numbers printed in the corner are off (for example, a slide marked “12” in the top right might actually be slide 14/47 of the PDF). In short, don’t trust the small number printed on the slide itself.
